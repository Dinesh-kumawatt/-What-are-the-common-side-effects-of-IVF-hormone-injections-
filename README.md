# -What-are-the-common-side-effects-of-IVF-hormone-injections-

When a woman starts IVF treatment, she takes hormone injections to help her body produce more eggs. These are called ovarian stimulation injections. Theyâ€™re a big part of the IVF cycle, but like any medicine, they can come with side effects.

The most common side effect is bloating or heaviness in the stomach. Since your ovaries are producing many eggs, they get bigger and make your tummy feel full. This usually happens after a few days of injections.

Another common issue is mood swings or emotional ups and downs. Hormones can affect your feelings. Some women feel extra emotional, cry easily, or get irritated. Itâ€™s normal and usually goes away after the injections stop.

Headache

Breast tenderness

Tiredness or weakness

Mild abdominal pain

Sometimes, women worry about weight gain. Most of the weight gain is water retentionâ€”not fat. It goes away after the cycle.

A rare but serious side effect is Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This happens if the ovaries overreact. Symptoms include severe bloating, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. If you feel any of these, contact your doctor immediately.

Also, some women may get mild bruising or pain at the injection site. Itâ€™s good to change injection spots and apply cold packs if it hurts.

The important thing to know isâ€”not everyone gets side effects, and most of them are temporary. If you're under expert care, your hormone doses are adjusted as per your response. Good clinics track your blood tests and ultrasound to avoid any major problems.

At Trinity IVF Ahmedabad, hormone therapy is given with close monitoring. Their doctors adjust the dose carefully, explain how to take the injections, and guide you if any symptoms show up. They also provide emotional support, which really helps.
